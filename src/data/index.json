            "description": "In the 333gle project, I developed a multithreaded web server with search engine capabilities, similar to Google's infrastructure. The server, managed by a central HttpServer, efficiently handles client connections using a dynamic ThreadPool. Leveraging the HttpServer_ThrFn() function, requests are parsed and routed dynamically, mirroring Google's query processing. Having integrated web server functionalities with search capabilities, this project showed me the fascinating resemblance to industry-leading search engines like Google.",
